[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phoefgen/undarked.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phoefgen/undarked)


Takes the dark, and makes in undarked. Always.


The overall goal of this project is to build an undefeatable, unkillable light
switch.

This project is designed to eventually demonstrate the following concepts:

-- High availability deployment.
-- Continuous Delivery and Deployment concepts.
-- Multiple service redundancy.
-- Remediation and monitoring concepts and implementation.
